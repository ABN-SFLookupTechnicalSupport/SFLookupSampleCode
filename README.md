Sample code is available for download and covers C# for .Net 3.5 Framework. You are actively encouraged to expand and enhance the offerings available here.

To run the sample code, you need a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) which we will provide when you register for access to the Super Fund Lookup [web services](https://superfundlookup.gov.au/Tools/WebServices).  

The free [SF Lookup tools](https://superfundlookup.gov.au/Tools/LookupTool) provide working examples of the web services. You do not need to be registered for access to the web services to use the SF Lookup tools.
